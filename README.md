# hello-world

Hello

I am a PhD candidate of Biomedical Health Informatics, minoring in biostatistics. My work is focused on developing objective and reproducible biomarkers through neuroinformatics. My dissertation is aimed at the computation of individual-subject network models using graph theory, genetic phenotyping, and magnetic resonance imaging. My career goal is to continue to propose, develop, and test innovative neuroinformatics methods for objective clinical assessment and monitoring of brain health.
